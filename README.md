# Project-1-game
## Game Choice - 2048

## HTML
    First we have to setup the html
      - Div class for the header which contains the title and score
      - Div class to display the winning message or to display the restart button
      - Main div clas for the grid then inside that div have 4 div rows with 4 cells inside each row
## CSS
    Mess around slightly with the css just to get the proper positioning for the header and for the game grid. 
        - Most of the styling can be done after the JS
## JS
    - Create the variables
    - Function to initialize the game
    - Functions to add/update and move the tiles
    - Function to show either a loss message or a win message that connects to the Div class
